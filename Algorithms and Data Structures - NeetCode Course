Static Arrays (fixed sized arrays)

Contiguous block of data, stored the same way in RAM
Read or Write to data

Reading a value happens in constant time O(1)

Array time complexity
r/w element O(1)
insert/remove at the end O(1)
insert middle O(n)
remove middle O(n)

Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # uniquenums = sorted(set(nums))
        # nums[:len(uniquenums)] = uniquenums
        # return len(uniquenums)
 
 # Two pointers method
        l = 1 # l moves only when a unique value is added to the spot its in
        for r in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[r] != nums[r - 1]: # r is checking if the number r is at is the same as the previous number
                nums[l] = nums[r] # if its not the same then put the value of r into the position of l
                l += 1 # because something was added to l, l can move up to the next spot
        return l # return l bc that will return the position which is what the q wants
