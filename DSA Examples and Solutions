Two Sum - Hash Maps and Arrays
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        prevMap = {}  # hashmap to remember numbers we've seen (number -> index)

        # loop through the list with index (i) and number (n)
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):  #enumerate adds the index
            diff = target - n  # the number we need to find to reach the target
            
            # if the "needed number" is already in our hashmap,
            # that means we found the pair (the previous one and the current one)
            if diff in prevMap:
                return [prevMap[diff], i]  # return their indexes
            
            # otherwise, store the current number and its index in the hashmap
            prevMap[n] = i  

        # not really needed since the problem guarantees a solution,
        # but it's here for completeness
        return

Valid Anagram - Hash Maps and Arrays
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # if the lengths are different, they can never be anagrams
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        countS, countT = {}, {}  # hashmap to count characters in s and t

        # loop through both words at the same time
        for i in range(len(s)):
            # add +1 to the count of the character in s
            countS[s[i]] = 1 + countS.get(s[i], 0)

            # add +1 to the count of the character in t
            countT[t[i]] = 1 + countT.get(t[i], 0)

        # now compare the counts of every character in s
        for c in countS:
            # if a character in s doesn't match the count in t, not an anagram
            if countS[c] != countT.get(c, 0):
                return False

        # if all counts match, it's an anagram
        return True

Other easier solution
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)


Group Anagrams - Hash Maps and Arrays
def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:

    for s in strs:  # loop through every word in the input list
        count = [0] * 26  # create a list of 26 zeros, one for each letter a-z
                           # count[i] will store how many times letter i appears in the word

        # count the frequency of each letter in the current word
        for c in s:
            # ord(c) - ord("a") converts letter to index: 'a' -> 0, 'b' -> 1, ..., 'z' -> 25
            # increment the count at that index
            count[ord(c) - ord("a")] += 1

        # convert the list of counts to a tuple so it can be used as a dictionary key
        # this tuple is a "signature" for the word: all anagrams will have the same signature
        key = tuple(count)

        # add the word to the group corresponding to its signature
        if key not in res:
            res[key] = []  # create a new list if this is the first word with this signature
        res[key].append(s)  # append the current word to the correct anagram group

    # return all groups of anagrams as a list of lists
    return list(res.values())
